# TodoThis

By: Matt Peck

## Purpose

I wanted to take some time to recreate one of my favorite web apps from scratch and use it to show my skills and technology interestings publicly since most of my work private.

I'm a huge fan of [Todoist]('https://todoist.com/') - I use it daily - and I thought it would be fun to re-engineer the free version of the app just by using analyzing the functionality and attempting to mimick it.

## Hours

It's important for me to keep track of my time while working on side projects, because it helps me understand my own level of expertise, but also expose areas that need work.
